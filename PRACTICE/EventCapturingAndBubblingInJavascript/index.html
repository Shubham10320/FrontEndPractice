    //whenever we use addEventListner or inline js  event propogate happens 
    //event propogate means event growing
    //event propogate happens in two step :-       1.capture phase            2.bubbling phase

    //capturing phase => 
    //event grow hoga e.g=>body->grandparent->parent->childe but but 
    //jab hum body ya phir grandparent pe click krege tab automatically parent and child 
    // tigger nhi hoga jese bubbling m hota hai



    //bubbling phase=>
    //event grow hoga and jab child pe ya phir parent pe click hoga toh uper ke sab event automaticcally trigger ho jayge 









    // event propagation happens in 2step
    // 1.event capture => firstly it will capture all event for example body->grandparent->parent->child
    //   but it wont execute any event it will only capture all event like a storing
    //   it move like up to down 
    //   but if we have mention that captue true then while capturing it will definetly execute that event do to so below is the example

    // grandParent.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
    //       console.log('grandparent')
    // })
    // parent.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
    //     console.log('parent');
    //     {captue:true}
    // })

     //in above example when we  will click on any event than capturing will done and while capturing it will execute the parent  bcoz we have mention do to so...


    //  ONCE CAPTURING DONE Then 

    // 2.event bubbling happens =>when will will click on parent then it will excute grandparent and body event as well it move like down to up


    //e.stopPropogation()
    // e.stopImmediatePropogation()

</script>


<!-- 
now 
 as above example when we click on any event 
 first it will capture all event while capturing we are saying to capture parent so body->grandparent->parent it will execute its work->child 
 now all event has captured and assume we have click on child so 
 chile will execute then parent is already executed so it wont execute again after that grandparent will execute then body will execute -->

 


 <!-- example=>======>  IIMPORTANT VERY MUCH 
 i clicked on child so event propogate will happen and it have 2 step capture and bubbling
 so it will capture the all event but i have mention to capture the parent so example is 
 body captured->grandparent captured -> parent it will execute what ever it happen ->child captured 
 now capturing phase done 

 so it will execute child event then it will go for parent, parent has already executed so it will not execute parent
 and it will execute the grandparent then body will get executed -->


<!-- 
This will execute only once 

 parent.addEventListener("click", (e)=>{
   console.log('hii')
 },{once:true}) -->



 <!-- if we have more than 1 event on same element and what to execute only one event and for another event it stop then we can use e.stopImmediatePropogation() 
      it use to stop event if one elem have more then 1 event
